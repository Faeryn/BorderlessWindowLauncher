# NWNLauncher

Launcher for Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced edition.
Features:
- Log rotation (saves your logs into separate files when the game exits)
- Borderless window mode without minimizing when you click outside the window (useful for multi-monitor setups)

Put the exe into the same folder as your nwmain.exe file is, then use it to launch the game.  
**Make sure that in Settings, the game is set to Windowed mode.**

If you are using Steam:
- In Library, right click Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition
- Properties
- General
- Change Launch Options to the following:

```"c:\Steam\steamapps\common\Neverwinter Nights\bin\win32\nwnlauncher.exe" %command%```

Of course replace the path to where your NWN is.
